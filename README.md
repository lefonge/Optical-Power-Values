# Description
This project automates the extraction of the Tx and Rx power values from Nokia and Juniper devices and provide .csv files for consultation to check whether the power values are good. This could be useful in migration or maintenance scenarios.

# Process:
## Step 1
Basically an ansible-playbook is run to collect the power values from the Juniper and Nokia nodes with the following commands (please edit the inventory files to reflect your device IP addresses):

Juniper: ansible-playbook -u admin -i inventory_hostname_junos junos_commands.yml
Nokia: ansible-playbook -u admin --inventory inventory_hostname sros_classic.yml

Two files are generated with the playbooks above which are:

juniper_output.txt
nokia_output.txt

## Step 2
These files are served as input files to respectively (the python code has been generated by ChatGPT):

python3 junos_optical_v1.5.py
python3 sros_optical_v1.5.py

These two python scripts are executed at once by means of a bash script that is “./run_optical_scripts.sh”

## Step 3
The bash script above generates two csv files where the optical power values are reported:

-	juniper_optical_power.csv
-	nokia_optical_power.csv
