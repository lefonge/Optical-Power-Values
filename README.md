# Description
This project automates the extraction of the Tx and Rx power values from Nokia and Juniper devices and provide .csv files for consultation to check whether the power values are good. This could be useful in migration or maintenance scenarios.

# Requirements:

This project has been run against Nokia SROS 24.10.R3 and Juniper vJunosEvolved 23.2R2.21-EVO
For Nokia SROS a license is required (this is not provided in the project) while for Junos no license is necessary.
This setup has also been run with Containerlab (https://containerlab.dev/) for which I'm providing also the yaml file for spinning up the devices once Containerlab is installed.

# Process:
## Step 1
Define the hosts in the inventory files:

- Nokia: inventory_hostname
- Juniper: inventory_hostname_junos

## Step 2
Basically an ansible-playbook is run to collect the power values from the Juniper and Nokia nodes with the following commands (as stated above, please edit the inventory files to reflect your device IP addresses):

- Juniper: ansible-playbook -u admin -i inventory_hostname_junos junos_commands.yml
- Nokia: ansible-playbook -u admin -i inventory_hostname sros_classic.yml

Two files are generated with the playbooks above which are:

- juniper_output.txt
- nokia_output.txt

## Step 3
These files are served as input files to respectively (the python code has been generated by ChatGPT):

- python3 junos_optical_v1.6.py
- python3 sros_optical_v1.7.py

These two python scripts are executed at once by means of a bash script that is “./run_optical_scripts.sh”

## Step 4
The bash script above generates two csv files where the optical power values are reported:

-	juniper_optical_power.csv
-	nokia_optical_power.csv
